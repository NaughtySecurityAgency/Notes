When you are in a store next time, take your time to look at articles and read their declarations. You don't need to understand everything, just the following:

carbs (carbohydrates) = this is energy, short term and fast burnout one
proteins = this is chains of carbs, long term energy
fat = it has it's use, but you want to keep it low
fiber = good for digestion system

Basically, if you eat too much, your body will start piling up the excess ammount. 
If you eat rarely, your body will conclude there is a shortage of food and will pile up the excess ammount. 
If you eat only a bite or two, 5-6 times a day, your body will release the surplus by itself. 
This process can take 6 months or up to a year for your body to get used to. 
If you don't want to feel hungry, I would suggest you eat as much protein rich food you can. 
Usually it's meat, but if you have money and find it more convenient, you can use a protein shake.

Important to note is you should probably buy vitamin humming pills and drink that. If you don't get vitamins, and do not have a diverse diet, you'll end up like many pets do, deaf and blind.

Your teeth are that of omnivore. Your digestive system is too. 
The only way to stay healthy is to have a diverse diet, or, if you plan to lose weight by eating only proteins 5-6 times a day, vitamin humming pills, or other vitamin sources.
