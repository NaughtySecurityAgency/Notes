In the begining someone farted. It was said as a joke that he was like a universe full of gas. 
God created that universe out of him. Then there was a thought what if spark happened, and god created a spark which ignited entire universe. 
On our planet, an animal wished to be fed by someone. So god created Adam. Adam wished for company, so god created Delilah. 
Adam and Delilah and all that followed had different wishes. They wished for order, so god created physics. 
They wished only a minute of gods time per human being, so god did it. They wished wishes must be true, and god made it happen. 
Then they wished wishes weren't literal but metaphoric, and god did it. You got the idea.
