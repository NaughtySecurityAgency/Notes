I beleive some time ago our planet was covered with some sort of space dust. 
And that space dust was remains of some far away planet that exploded. 
And that space dust contained what I like to call parasites, but are actually some sort of containers with living beings inside. 
Call them souls if you want.
I got infected with a female one when I was a child, and in an effort for it to have pleasure, I ended up raped. Multiple times.
When I first saw a computer, I became obsessed with them. 
And it was actually parasites doing, because they seem to use digital ways of spreading.
They basically collaborate on social networks on which one of them will enter or leave which human. 
And they seem to require a person sleeping close to a pc to either leave or enter the person.
When I got infected with one at age of 23, which was highly incompatible, I developed a mental illness. 
The incompatibility caused my brain to collapse and break.
The parasites take full control of human nervous system, and they create a cocoon of some sort in their mind, where the humans and
the parasites thoughts are being merged.
Therefore, I beleive people changing sex, or mental patients in mental institutions simply need to be close to a running PC for the
parasite to leave their body and mind.
I don't know what their agenda is, but we seem to be getting highly techonologically advanced in a short ammount of time, and they
may be wanting to use us to go back home. And they seem to require AI and advanced tech to do it. 
Since they are individuals, they are all disconnected, and I think they want to use AI to actually coordinate between themselves.
But those individuals aren't angels, most of them will hurts in ways beyond imagination.
