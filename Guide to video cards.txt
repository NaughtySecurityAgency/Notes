The following is MAXIMUM any video card can achieve, regardless of make, brand or model. 
The figures are approximate, but you should get an idea of what to expect from card you intend to purchase. 
In highly populated areas it is normal for framerate to drop, and you can split the final figure in half if the game is using double precision (64 bit). 
I suggest checking both wikipedia articles, and some other sites, like for example techpowerup database to calculate FPS figures from given math. 
The result should be approximately the same as any website testing results online, but this should help with older cards and newer titles calculations, which probably nobody is doing.

[resolution (single screen)]
60 gigapixels per second = 6k = 3840x2160
50 gigapixels per second = 5k = 3200x1800
40 gigapixels per second = 4k = 2560x1440
30 gigapixels per second = 3k = 1920x1080
20 gigapixels per second = 2k = 1280x720

[fps]
DX12: 1000 GFLOPS = 15 fps
DX11: 1000 GFLOPS = 30 fps
DX10: 1000 GFLOPS = 60 fps
DX9: 1000 GFLOPS = 120 fps

[precision]
Half precision = 16 bit
Single precision = 32 bit
Double precision = 64 bit

[example]
gtx 1060 has 4 tflops and 80gps.
rx 570 has 5 tflops and 60gps
That means that gtx 1060 can show image at 2x 4k screens at 120 fps in dx11 32 bit titles
That also means that under above conditions, rx 570 will perform roughly the same since it lacks gps,
but on single screen or lower res will perform better then gtx 1060 since it has more gflops
