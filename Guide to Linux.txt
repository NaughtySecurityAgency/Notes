Maybe you need a stable miniature OS that runs everything. Don't debloat, download mini iso:

#http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/

Burn with rufus to stick or if you're on Linux, type this:

#sudo dd if=pathtoiso of=nameofusbdevice(sdb)

Boot from stick but not EFI. Do BIOS boot.

Follow the instructions and when offered software, don't pick anything. After reboot, there wont be a GUI, so press ctrl + alt + F1 to get terminal. 
You can now set root password. This account isn't accessible without a password set, but if you need it, type:

#sudo passwd root

Now you can download GUI. For example xfce:

#sudo apt install xfce4

Lightdm is essential for some gpus to show picture on screen, so pick lightdm.

#sudo apt install lightdm

After that set to auto boot:

#sudo dpkg-configure ligthdm

Now you can install a browser:

#sudo apt install firefox

Or:

#sudo apt install chromium-browser

If you need to search for specific package, like nvidia driver latest build, type:

#sudo apt search nvidia-driver-*

To install it, type:

#sudo apt install nvidia-driver-435

If you wish to do uninstall, type:

#sudo apt remove appname

Above command can be used with wildcards too:

#sudo apt remove nvidia*

If you also wish to remove dependencies of app you uninstalled:

#sudo apt autoremove

All packages are in picked repos. To expand and add more repos:

#sudo apt install software-properties-common

#sudo add-apt-repository multiverse

Alternatively, you can use nano editor and edit the repo list manually:

#sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

After changing repos, refresh your system:

#sudo apt update

If you need a list of packages in all repos:

#sudo apt list

If you find a 3rd party package, you will need package manager to install it:

#sudo apt install gdebi

If you have unmanaged devices:

#sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

Add this:

#[keyfile]

#unmanaged-devices=none

CTRL+O to save, enter to confirm and CTRL+X to exit. You can restart services like this:

#sudo service network-manager restart

Snap is like chocolatey on windows:

#sudo snap install discord

Then just run discord with:

#sudo /snap/bin/discord

4 music:

#sudo apt install clementine

4 videos:

#sudo snap install vlc

4 torrents:

#sudo apt install transmission

4 archives:

#sudo apt install file-roller

4 rar files:

#sudo apt install unrar

2 manage drives:

#sudo apt install gparted

2 edit photos:

#sudo apt install gimp

If you need gdrive:

#sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alessandro-strada/ppa

#sudo apt install google-drive-ocamlfuse

#mkdir /home/username/google-drive

#google-drive-ocamlfuse /home/username/google-drive

Where username is your username

2 setup access:

#sudo nano /etc/security/access.conf

edit it with:

#+:yourusername:LOCAL

#+:root:tty1

#-:ALL:ALL

With above edit you allowed yourself to logon locally, root to logon on terminal, and block everyone else from everywhere

Now type:

#reboot

Click the white button before typing in your password and change to xfce4.
If you need some other desktop, you simply add it:

#sudo apt install kubuntu-desktop

2 play games:

#sudo apt install steam

Linux makes a difference between capital and lowercase letters and will return error if it is not exact.

That's it. Enjoy!
